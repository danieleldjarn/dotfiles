# Dotfiles

This repository contains scripts that I use to set up a new Mac or Ubuntu machine 

## Mac

### Install xcode

Download and install Xcode from Apple's [website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) then install Xcode command line tools by running

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Run setup.sh

The insipiration for the setup.sh script comes originally from [thomaspoignant/mac-dev-setup](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/mac-dev-setup).
The script is a work in process and might not work perfectly

Run the script

```bash
./mac/setup.sh
```

## Ubuntu or dirivatives

Run the script

```bash
./linux/setup.sh
```
